This demo exercises the DelphiDabbler About Box Component.

The demo may compile with Delphi 6 and earlier, but this has not been tested.

Delphi 7 users, use the .dpr project file.

Delphi 2006 users (and Delphi 2005?), open the .bdsproj file.

Delphi 2007 users will need to delete the .dproj file and load the .dpr file.

Delphi 2009 and later users load the .dproj file.

Note 1:
TSpinEdit from "Samples" palette is required to build the demo. If this
component is not present the demo will not compile.

Note 2:
You may need to add the path to the package containing the About Box Component
binaries to the project options.
